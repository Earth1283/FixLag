# Smart Clear: Automatically clears entities when TPS (Ticks Per Second) drops below a defined threshold.

  # The TPS (Ticks Per Second) threshold. If the server's 1-minute average TPS drops below this value,

  # A healthy server runs at 20.0 TPS. Values like 16.0 - 18.0 are common.

  # How often (in seconds) the plugin will check the server's current TPS.
  # A lower value means faster reaction to lag spikes, but slightly more frequent checks.

  # The cooldown period (in seconds) after a Smart Clear has been triggered.
  # The plugin will not trigger another Smart Clear until this cooldown has passed,
  # even if the TPS remains below the threshold. This prevents excessive cleanups.
  # Example: 300 seconds = 5 minutes.
